# Build an AI Agent in Python

We're **building a toy version of Claude Code** using Google's Gemini API! As long as you have an LLM at your disposal, it's actually surprisingly simple to build a (somewhat) effective custom agent.

### What Does the Agent Do?

The program we're building is a CLI tool that:

1. Accepts a coding task (e.g., "strings aren't splitting in my app, pweeze fix 🥺👉🏽👈🏽")
2. Chooses from a set of predefined functions to work on the task, for example:
    - Scan the files in a directory
    - Read a file's contents
    - Overwrite a file's contents
    - Execute the Python interpreter on a file
3. Repeats step 2 until the task is complete (or it fails miserably, which is possible)

For example, I have a buggy calculator app, so I used my agent to fix the code:

```console
> uv run main.py "fix my calculator app, it's not starting correctly"
# Calling function: get_files_info
# Calling function: get_file_content
# Calling function: write_file
# Calling function: run_python_file
# Calling function: write_file
# Calling function: run_python_file
# Final response:
# Great! The calculator app now seems to be working correctly. The output shows the expression and the result in a formatted way.
```

### Learning Goals

The learning goals of this project are as follows:

1. Get an introduction to multi-directory Python projects.
2. Understand how the AI tools that you'll almost certainly use on the job actually work under the hood.
3. Practice your Python and functional programming skills.

The goal is *not* to build an LLM from scratch, but instead to use a pre-trained LLM to build an *agent* from scratch.
